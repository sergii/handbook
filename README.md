### Processes

__Feature Toggles__
* For safer, incremental releases and testing we use [Launchdarkly](https://launchdarkly.com) free tier or [Flipper gem](https://github.com/flippercloud/flipper). Feature toggles enable incremental releases, testing in production, A/B testing, quick rollbacks, selective user experiences, and effective feature management, enhancing flexibility and reducing risk in the development process.

__Developer Portal__
* [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) from Spotify
