[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) is an agile process framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called [sprints](https://github.com/sergii/handbook/tree/master/Product%20Development%20Sprint/Scrum), no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed [stand-up]() meetings, called daily scrums.
